# Simple practice for HTML/CSS/JS
## Description:

This project is just for getting familiar with HTML/CSS/JS, which can help you to understand the connection of <br> CSS and JS. <br> <br>
In the project, I implemented the sliding door effect of the navigation bar, the two-way binding of the navigation bar <br> 
and the sidebar, and some other animation effects. You can download the project to view the specific effects.
